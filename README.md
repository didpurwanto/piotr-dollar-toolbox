Original source code can bedownload in : http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/research.html

This toolbox will help us to find:
1. STIP (Spatio Temporal Interest Point)
2. Feature Eaxtraction including HOG, HOF, APR, WW
3. Bag of Words (K-Means)

This is very popular toolbox to process some computer vision problem.

To install this toolbox in your MATLAB, you just need to add all the folder in your path manager.

I give a simple example in folder Example, file 'prog2.m'. In this example, I just find the STIP from 3 Dimentional frame (input video) and extract HOG and HOF feature.
